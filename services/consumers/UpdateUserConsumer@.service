# 
# This file is to manage the specific consumer: UpdateUserConsumer 
#
# To start this worker, just one, you can run `sudo systemctl start UpdateUserConsumer@1.service
#
# To start 10 workers, you can run `sudo systemctl start UpdateUserConsumer@{1..10}.service
# which creates 10 worker instances of UpdateUserConsumer service.
# These can be managed on a per instance basis by referring to UpdateUserConsumer@5 for
# the 5th instance. Or you can use the shorthand syntax to manage all or more than one...
# `sudo systemctl restart UpdateUserConsumer@{1..10}.service` which will restart all 10.
#
# When `app.service` is restarted, then all consumers will be automatically restarted,
# as per [Unit] PartOf directive.
#
# %i will be replaced with whatever comes after @ in `systemctl start UpdateUserConsumer@Instance.service`
